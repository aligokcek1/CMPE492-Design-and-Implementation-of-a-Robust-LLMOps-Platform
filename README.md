# CMPE492-Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Robust-LLMOps-Platform
This project builds an event-driven pipeline for managing LLM lifecycles. Integrating MLOps and DataOps, it creates a scalable system to automate dataset registration, fine-tuning, deployment, and monitoring. The goal is to optimize workflows for sustainable AI development through hands-on experimentation with modern tools.
